# BasicBudgetApp

This is a basic budgeting app which sets initial budgets for different categories (food, clothing, & entertainment).
Once these categories have been set up with their budgets, the user of the app can withdraw, deposit, transfer, & check balance.
The budget will always be updated after each action on budgetfile.txt.
